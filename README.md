GDINA Package for Cognitive Diagnosis Modelling with Polytomous Attributes

Features of the package
-----------------------
-   Estimating PGDINA model and a variety of widely-used models subsumed by the PGDINA model for polytomous attributes, including the pDINA model, pDINO model, and pA-CDM
-   Estimating models within the G-DINA model framework using user-specified design matrix and link functions
-   Estimating Bugs-DINA, DINO and G-DINA models for dichotomous responses
-   Estimating sequential G-DINA model for ordinal and nominal responses
-   Estimating the diagnostic tree model (experimental)
-   Modelling independent, saturated, higher-order, loglinear smoothed, and structured joint attribute distribution
-   Accommodating multiple-group model analysis
-   Imposing monotonic constrained success probabilities
-   Accommodating binary and polytomous attributes
-   Validating Q-matrix under the general model framework
-   Evaluating absolute and relative item and model fit
-   Comparing models at the test and item levels
-   Detecting differential item functioning using Wald and likelihood ratio test
-   Simulating data based on all aforementioned CDMs
-   Providing graphical user interface for users less familiar with R
